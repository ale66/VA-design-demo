# VA-design-demo

This repository holds the jupyter notebooks for demonstrating the [V&A Design Generator project](https://github.com/ale66/VA-design-demo) where users can input prompts and output images of V&A inspired made up objects representing these prompts. 

Here is an example:

![An example of a generated image](images/example-statuette.jpeg "An example of a generated image")

You can either run the notebook locally or you can host it on a web server by running the command: `voila demo.ipynb`

This will host your demo as a link on `localhost:8866`

Note that this notebook depends on model files and data that are saved in Vasari at VA-design-generator/

You will need access to these files in order to run this on a different computer. 
Please reach out to daphnedemekas@gmail.com if you want these files 

Enjoy!
