# VA-design-demo

This repository holds the V&A Design Generator jupyter notebook where users can input prompts and output images of V&A inspired made up objects representing these prompts. 

You can either run the notebook locally or you can host it on a web server by running the command: `voila demo..ipynb`

This will host your demo as a link on `localhost:8866`

Enjoy!
